Some offensive tools that I am playing around with

----- ExploitShadow.py -----

I am trying to save some time on my OSCP exam and decided to build most of the exploit dev stages into one single python script where you can choose the mode based on where you are in the process. The only other thing you might need to configure that was not in the instructions are the way the "maliciousbuffer" variables get crafted, based on the application you're attacking; I'll leave that for you to decide.
